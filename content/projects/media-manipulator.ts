No account is needed for the standard tools, and guests' files are deleted within 24 hours; signed-in users choose their own retention, from 24 hours to 2 years.",
        "Motion, an SVG animation editor in beta, sits beside Darkroom: it turns an SVG into layers on a keyframe timeline and exports animated SVG, Lottie, React, JavaScript, Flutter or GIF straight from the browser.

Every tool's name and one-line description, the Pricing, Account and Voices pages and the site chrome are translated in all 18; every tool page is translated in full in all 18, down to the worked examples and FAQ (the Aperture photo pages are still being finished in a few languages), and English, Ukrainian, Russian and German are reviewed by native speakers. Hebrew, Spanish for Spain and Latin America, French, Italian, Portuguese for Portugal and Brazil, Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi and Vietnamese are machine-translated and stay out of search engines (noindex, no hreflang) until a native speaker signs each one off; a tool page whose body would fall back to English is never indexed under a translated address. Two of the languages are right to left, and a key-parity test keeps any translation from silently lagging. It is a CreaTV Ltd. product, and Darkroom is embedded directly in CreaTV Studio.",

An imported SVG becomes a layer tree of groups, paths, shapes, text, images, gradients, masks and clip paths; markup it cannot model is kept as an opaque layer that round-trips unchanged, and anything unsafe (scripts, event handlers, external references, foreignObject) is dropped on import and rebuilt from an allow-list, never inserted as HTML. New artwork comes from rectangle, ellipse, line, pen and text tools.",

Six one-click animators cover stroke draw-on, motion along a path, shape morphing (an in-house normaliser that matches command counts, start points and winding), gradient stops, masks and clip paths, and blur. One sampler is the single definition of a value at time t: the preview renders from it, and every exporter is tested against it.",
        "Export happens in the browser, and the server only counts it against a separate daily Motion allowance before the file is built. Animated SVG is pure CSS when Chrome, Firefox and Safari can all play it, and otherwise embeds a tree-shaken anime.js runtime of about 14 KB gzip. The Lottie writer targets spec 1.0.1 and has a matching reader; a single unsupported-feature list means nothing is dropped silently in either direction. The React, JavaScript/TypeScript and Flutter exporters (a native flutter_svg widget when the animation allows, otherwise a WebView player) are pure functions with golden fixtures. GIF uses a clean-room GIF89a encoder in a Worker, PNG sequences stream into a zip, and MP4 and WebM go through WebCodecs and mediabunny; the video formats are part of the Pro plan.",

A versioned, additive-only PhotoDoc lists the source, the geometry, the healed areas and an ordered stack of adjustment layers, each with an opacity, a blend mode and an optional mask. It is validated by Zod in the browser and by a Go sanitizer on the server against the same byte-parity fixtures, so the original file is never touched and any step can be reordered, faded or deleted later. Presets sync to your account: signed-in users keep their own looks on the server, capped per plan and validated by the same layer sanitizer, and a one-time prompt moves the presets already saved in the browser.",

The reference is plain TypeScript in colorMath.ts, with a unit-tested function per adjustment; the WebGL2 preview mirrors it stage for stage in GLSL on a 1920 px copy; the export is rendered from the full-resolution original on the server in NumPy and OpenCV. A golden-image harness renders 126 fixtures through the reference and compares the server's output with tolerances written down per kind of operation (colour operations within a few 8-bit levels, grain exact), so what the preview shows is what the export delivers. Only exposure and white balance work in linear light; the rest are gamma-space stages that clamp to the unit range.",

The subject mask and the Heal tool run on my own GPU (rembg and LaMa), so a photo never goes to a third-party service. Geometry is one inverse-mapped resample for crop, straighten, flip and four-corner perspective. Eighteen built-in looks, browser-stored user presets with JSON import and export, and a batch apply that renders one project per photo and zips the results complete the workflow.",

Without an account one photo lives in the browser, and only the export, subject mask or heal uploads it for that job.

Its knowledge is generated from the site's own registries by a script (every tool page, route, editor parameter, preset and shortcut), searched with BM25 on the API, and never edited by hand, so it stays current as features ship.",

Off-topic questions are turned away before any model call. Signed-in users keep their conversations under the retention period they chose, guests' chats are not stored, and every turn records only content-free usage and cost.",

The model never writes the photo document; it calls a closed set of nine operations (add or update a layer, grey everything except a colour, mask part of the photo, apply a look, auto tone, crop and straighten), checked against the same JSON Schema on the server before streaming and again in the browser before anything changes, then applied all or nothing through the editor's own code. It sees a small preview frame when you allow it, checks its own result once, and offers anything that costs an AI edit (subject mask, heal) as a button you click.",

It works through eighteen timeline operations (looks and grades, designed titles with entrance and exit animation, transitions, keyframes for Ken Burns moves and fades, speed and freeze frames, audio presets and ducking, splits, trims and markers) that land as one undo step, refuse anything on a locked track, and pass the server's own project sanitizer unchanged. Captions, voiceovers, voice cleanup and export stay buttons you click.

The six templates it uses (lower third, logo reveal, title pop, bullet reveal, counter, badge bounce) are also a Templates menu in Motion's top bar, and every one produces a document the server's sanitizer keeps byte for byte.",

Say what you want, or drop a file and say \"just run it\", and Medi prepares a single-tool job and shows a confirmation card with the settings in your language, the queue length and the allowance it would use. It never starts anything itself: a click is always required. Start runs in place for video compress, resize, rotate, crop and trim, audio extract and remove, and transcription; every other tool opens with Medi's settings prefilled. The settings are validated against the real option schema of about 90 tools, so an unsupported value is refused instead of changed, and the confirmation rate (confirmed over proposed) is tracked.",

Premium is 8 USD or 8 EUR a month, or 80 USD or 80 EUR a year, through Stripe, and brings larger files, more jobs and exports, output up to 2160p, and priority on the GPU queue. Cancelling keeps Premium until the end of the paid period, with a clear end date and an offer to stay.",
        "Pro sits above Premium at 15 USD or 15 EUR a month, or 150 USD or 150 EUR a year. Visitors choose the currency: Europe sees euros by default, a USD / EUR switch sits on the pricing page, in the billing panel and in the upgrade prompts, the choice is remembered, and a subscription keeps the currency it was bought in. The price is the same number in both currencies, there is no conversion, and no tax is added on top. It raises the daily allowances to 700 everyday jobs and 200 AI jobs, keeps Premium's file, length and resolution limits, and carries the largest allowance for Motion, the SVG animation editor: 150 exports a day and the MP4, WebM and PNG sequence video exports. Moving up is immediate, with a prorated charge and the same renewal date; moving down to Premium waits until the end of the paid period, so nothing is refunded mid-cycle. The Stripe price id decides the plan on the server, and an unknown price can never grant Pro. The pricing page and the billing panel read every number and price from the API.",

        "A native Android app, in closed testing, built with Expo and React Native in TypeScript, with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query on top of the same Go API and the same account as the website: it is signed-in only, so plans, limits, history and retention carry over. Files come in through Android's system pickers or the share sheet, the server-side tools run as tracked jobs, and a push notification through Firebase Cloud Messaging arrives when a long job finishes. The app is available in the same 18 languages, including right-to-left layouts for Arabic and Hebrew. The Aperture photo editor runs on the phone with the same document and shaders ported to Skia: the shared PhotoDoc, reference maths and golden fixtures are copied from the website, every GLSL stage has a Skia shader that is checked against the same goldens in CI, and exports are still rendered on the server; History reopens a past export for editing, a Projects list holds the saved projects, and the sixteen adjustment pages are rows in the Tools tab.",

Code updates ship over the air with EAS Update on a native-fingerprint runtime version, and a signed-in user can delete their account from the app, with a public web page for the same request. The Privacy Policy and Terms have a section for the app in all 18 languages.",
